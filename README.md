# Power Platform: Power Lift

This Project was made in collaboration with: Carolina, Guilherme, Lu√≠s and Sara. This project was made for the Upskill course of Power Platform!

## First Part: The Problem: Overview

The gym is embarking on a transformative journey to enhance its operations and member experience. This includes the implementation of a mobile application to regulate member access, gain insights into teacher performance, and discern the popularity of different classes. Furthermore, the gym aims to comprehensively digitize its operations, as its current technology infrastructure is virtually non-existent.

### Project Requirements

The gym's requirements include:

1. **A Dataverse-Powered Database:** Establish a robust Dataverse-based database to efficiently store student information, teacher profiles, class details, and real-time gym occupancy.

2. **User-Friendly Gym App:** Develop a user-friendly mobile application that serves as an interface within the gym. This app enables students to log in, select their desired classes, and manage their gym attendance seamlessly.

3. **Automated Email Notifications:** Implement an automated email notification system to communicate with students under specific conditions: a) when a user achieves a milestone of 100 consecutive gym visits and b) when a user misses two consecutive days of gym attendance.

4. **Comprehensive Data Analytics:** Create a data analytics system that aggregates and analyzes data collected from the app, providing valuable insights to help optimize gym operations and improve the overall experience for students.

### The Solution: Overview

To address the challenges faced by the gym, we have implemented the following solutions:

1) **Dataverse Tables**: We have established four key Dataverse tables, each serving a specific purpose: one for Students, one for Student Logins, one for Trainers, one for Classes, and a Fact Table. You can find detailed information about Dataverse [here](https://github.com/inesalves44/GymProject/blob/main/Dataverse/README_DATAVERSE.md)
  
2) **Power Apps Canvas App**: Our Power Apps Canvas App enables users to log in and select their desired classes. Additionally, it allows students to provide class feedback. You can explore the features and benefits of our Power Apps solution [here](https://github.com/inesalves44/GymProject/blob/main/PowerApps/README_POWER_APPS.md)

3) **Power Automate Flows**: We've designed two Power Automate flows for email notifications, enhancing communication and efficiency. Furthermore, three additional flows have been created to enhance backend operations.

4) **Power BI Dashboard and Report**: To facilitate data-driven decision-making for our management team, we've developed a comprehensive Power BI Dashboard and Report.

## Second Part: The Problem: Overview

After a great success with the app the company asked the team to create a website that contained a chatbot!
Also the company needed help to choose a new location, product to sell and what new sport to add.

### Project Requirements
To address the challenges faced by the gym, we have implemented the following solutions:

1. **An outside facing website:** Develop a user-friendly website that serves as an outside face for the gym. This app enables students to enroll, check the classes.

2. **Chatbot:** A chatbit that helps students to navigate the world of power lift!

3. **Market Reasearch:** Create a data analytics research that helps to answer the following questions: 1) where to open the new gym?; 2) what to sell in the gym?; 3) what modality should we include?.
